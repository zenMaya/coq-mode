#+title: Coq mode for Emacs

* Why =coq-mode= when there's [[https://proofgeneral.github.io/][Proof General]]?

Proof General is a great piece of software, even the Coq developers [[https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/41d597866d4f79fe5109c25c6f5cc57d0ebf7f0f][think so]].

The only problem is, that Proof General is not integrating into the Emacs ecosystem very well. What do I mean by that? Well, if you want to use [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org babel]] for example, it relies on =run-coq= function. But this function is unavailable in Proof General!

This is the repository that resurrects the old =coq-mode= for Emacs, as the files have been removed from the official coq repository.
